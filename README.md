# PWSched

PWSched is a web app designed to help schedule volunteers participating in public witnessing activities.  The app is based on three simple steps:

1. Admin creates available shifts
1. Volunteers request shifts
1. Admin approves volunteers for each shift

This version of PWSched is built using Ruby on Rails.
